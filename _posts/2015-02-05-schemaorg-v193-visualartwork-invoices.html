<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: left;">Version v1.93 of schema.org has just been <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v1.93">released</a>. &nbsp;As we mentioned in the <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2014/12/schemaorg-v192-music-video-games-sports.html">previous update</a> we are working towards a stable "version 2" release. This isn't yet v2.0, but it serves as a foundation,</div><div style="text-align: left;"><div>fixing a variety of small issues across many schemas and examples.&nbsp;</div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />This release also introduces new vocabulary for describing visual artworks: a new&nbsp;<a href="http://schema.org/VisualArtwork">VisualArtwork</a> type alongside supporting properties -&nbsp;<a href="http://schema.org/artEdition">artEdition</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/artform">artform</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://schema.org/material">material</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://schema.org/surface">surface</a>.  Many thanks to Paul Watson for leading that work. See also Paul's blog posts <a href="http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/arts-tech/posts/schemadotorg-visualartwork-goes-live">about the schema</a>, its <a href="http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/arts-tech/posts/mapping-vra-core-4-to-schemdotorg-visualartwork">mapping to the VRA Core 4</a>, and its<a href="http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/arts-tech/posts/getty-aat-linked-open-data-in-schemadotorg-visualartwork"> use with Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus</a> (AAT) via Linked Data.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Invoices and bills also now have dedicated vocabulary in schema.org, see the new <a href="http://schema.org/Invoice">Invoice</a> type for details. This addresses situations when an invoice is received that is not directly attached to an Order, for example utility bills.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">As usual then&nbsp;<a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v1.93">release notes</a>&nbsp;page has full details. In recent weeks we have been taking care to document the status of all schema.org open issues and proposals in our <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">issue tracker</a> on the Github site. As always, thanks are due to everyone who contributed to this release and to the ongoing discussions in Github and at W3C.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
