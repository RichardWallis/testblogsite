<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Schema.org partners, in collaboration with experts from the BBC and IPTC/SportsML, are pleased to share a proposal for improving the Schema.org sports vocabulary. &nbsp;The proposal includes support for describing <b>sports organizations</b>, <b>athletes</b>, and <b>events</b>, with a focus on the most common sports types being published on the Web today. Although the proposal includes support for describing sports statistics within these domains, the initial set of properties are limited to those which are broadly applicable.&nbsp; More detailed, sport-specific statistics will be the subject of future additions to the base statistic classes.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Schema.org sports vocabulary proposal is available as an exported PDF in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Sports" target="_blank">W3C Web Schemas - Sports wiki</a> and a machine readable version of the schema will be posted soon.&nbsp; We encourage the web community to review and provide feedback via the wiki, the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/" target="_blank">W3C public vocabs mailing list</a> (<a href="mailto:public-vocabs@w3.org">public-vocabs@w3.org</a>), or by joining the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sports-schema-collab" target="_blank">Schema.org sports vocabulary discussion group</a>.</span><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div>
