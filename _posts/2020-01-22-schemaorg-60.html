<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> version 6.0 has been released. See the <a href="https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v6.0">release notes</a> for full details. &nbsp;As always, the release notes have full details and links (including previous releases e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v5.0">5.0</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v4.0">4.0</a>).<br /><br />We are now aiming to release updated schemas on an approximately monthly basis (with longer gaps around vacation periods). Typically, new terms are first added to our "Pending" area to give time for the definitions to benefit from implementation experience before they are added to the "core" of Schema.org. As always, many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release of Schema.org.<br /><br />--<br />Dan Brickley, for Schema.org.<br /><br /></div>
