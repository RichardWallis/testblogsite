<div>Over the past few years we have seen a number of application areas benefit from Schema.org markup. Schema.org discussions have often centered around the importance of ease of use, simplicity and adoption for publishers and webmasters. While those principles will continue to guide our work, it is also important to work to make it easier to consume structured data, by building applications and making more use of the information it carries. We are therefore happy to welcome the new <a href="https://www.datacommons.org/">Data&nbsp;Commons</a> initiative, which is devoted to sharing such datasets, beginning with a corpus of fact check data based on the schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview markup</a> as adopted by many fact checkers around the world. We expect that this work will benefit the wider ecosystem around structured data by encouraging use and re-use of schema.org related datasets. </div>
