We'd like to share a link to a recent set of presentation slides by Peter Mika, Ralph Rabbat, Philip Bohannon of Yahoo! The talk by Ralph Rabbat was part of the Industry Track during October's International Semantic Web Conference in Bonn. Slides (in .pptx format) are linked from the <a href="http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/program/industry-track/">conference site </a> and describe some work they're doing that relates to <a href="http://schema.org/"> schema.org</a>. This presentation covers some aspect of Yahoo's work in semantic web both from engineering and research aspect. Please, feel free to connect directly with the authors if you have any comments/questions. The other Industry Track presentations, and materials from the <a href="http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/program/"> wider conference</a>; are worth checking out too.
