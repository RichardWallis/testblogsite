<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Schema.org 3.3 has been <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.3">released</a>. As always, the release was prepared, debated and finalized by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">schema.org community group</a>, and features a range of additions, adjustments, bugfixes and clarifications to improve the expressiveness and usability of our schemas.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">See the <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.3">release notes</a> for full details, but of particular note are some changes made around the NewsArticle type (in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.thetrustproject.org/">Trust Project</a>&nbsp;on whose work this is largely based). For many years, our definition of NewsArticle was simply "a news article". With this release we add (via our "pending" mechanism) some more subtlety around <a href="http://schema.org/docs/news.html">News</a>, making it possible to mark-up categories of news including opinion pieces, background articles, reportage, as well as as also introducing types for satirical and advertiser content. We also <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1525">add</a> properties that encourage greater transparency around News creation and publication. These are flagged as "pending" to emphasize that early adopter feedback on the new vocabulary is particularly welcomed, via <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">Github</a>, the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">group</a>, or the site's&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/docs/feedback.html">feedback form</a>. These developments complement our earlier work to support interoperability amongst fact-checking sites via the <a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview</a> type. Following discussion at <a href="http://about.poynter.org/node/102080">GlobalFact4 conference</a>, we have also <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1687">amended</a> the definition of the "<a href="http://schema.org/expires">expires</a>" to highlight its applicability to fact checking content.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Other highlights of 3.3 include new terminology (also pending implementor feedback) for describing <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1156">legislation</a>, <span style="background-color: white; color: #333333;">based on the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/eli/">European Legislation Identifier (ELI) ontology</a>&nbsp;and the work of the&nbsp;<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli-register/about.html" style="background-color: white; border-bottom: 1px dotted rgb(153, 0, 0); color: #990000; text-decoration-line: none;">ELI taskforce</a><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="background-color: white;">. We have also added an overview page giving more details on our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/financial.html">finance</a>-related terminology, contributed by the FIBO community, alongside a proposed design for describing <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1457">schedules</a>, new subtypes distinguishing user from critic reviews, and a generalization of our recipes schema called "<a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g647">HowTo</a>" for recipe-like tasks that don't result in food. We've also added types for <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1459">TouristAttraction</a> and for <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1624">PublicToilet</a>...</span></span></span></div></div>
