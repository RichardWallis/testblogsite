This defines a simple approach for tagging fact checking articles that has been collaboratively developed and documented through Schema.org. For more background for a journalistic and factchecking audience, see Duke Reporters' Lab's dedicated site.&amp;nbsp;At&amp;nbsp;Full Fact we have recently been exploring ways to revise and extend the claim review metadata to provide more detail that might enable further reuse and labelling of content, and further insights into the fact checking process.Our investigation has covered the following areas:Current scope and application of ClaimReview. The currently defined model provides a lot of flexibility around how much detail might be included in a review, with Google, Bing and others recommending specific profiles of that in their structured markup documentation.

While it's hard to predict exactly what the next decade will bring, if we can all keep these founding concerns in mind as we improve, refine and curate our growing collection of schemas, we'll be doing our part to continue improving the web.Dan &amp;amp; GuhaFor Schema.org.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Announcing Schema Markup Validator: validator.schema.org (beta)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/05/11/announcing-schema-markup-validator.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Announcing Schema Markup Validator: validator.schema.org (beta)" /><published>2021-05-11T17:14:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-05-11T17:14:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/05/11/announcing-schema-markup-validator</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/05/11/announcing-schema-markup-validator.html">&lt;div&gt;Announcing preview availability of &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.schema.org&quot;&gt;validator.schema.org&lt;/a&gt; for review and feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/2020Dec/0002.html&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/12/structured-data-testing-tool-update&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, Schema.org is the new home for the structured data validator previously known as the Structured Data Testing Tool (SDTT).

During the early months of the pandemic, this community responded with an important upgrade to the nation’s health IT infrastructure to democratize access more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/connecting-americans-coronavirus-information-online/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;trusted health information online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthit.gov/news/events/accelerating-apis-healthcare-year-review-and-momentum-2021&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;API Summit&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, Kathy Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced an open collaboration that builds upon the same regulations and industry standards to improve another important aspect of the consumer health navigation experience - searching for timely, accurate provider directory information.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For many Americans, finding a health plan that includes their trusted providers is critically important, but often requires tedious work looking up each plan’s provider directory. Sadly, as CMS found in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ManagedCareMarketing/Downloads/Provider_Directory_Review_Industry_Report_Round_3_11-28-2018.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 50% of provider directories contained inaccuracies regarding whether the provider was accepting new patients, practicing at the address listed, or reachable via the listed phone number.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regulators have attempted to solve these problems by imposing penalties on government-sponsored plans for inaccurate information, but an additional solution may be at hand. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/interoperability-and-patient-access-fact-sheet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;provision&lt;/a&gt; embedded in CMS’ interoperability regulations requires government-sponsored health plans to publish machine-readable access to timely directory information by July 2021. In an effort to reduce administrative burdens, a multi-stakeholder collaborative is looking to both improve the quality of physician websites to include this information and to enable health plans to source timely, accurate information from them to comply with the rules.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Similar to the work that was done to make it easier for consumers to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://carejourney.com/covid-schema-playbook/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;COVID announcements&lt;/a&gt; on physician websites, such as testing availability, revised office hours or telemedicine services, this collaborative will work to standardize how to publish structured provider directory information. To further simplify the search experience, providers can now publish their website URL when updating their “digital contact information” on CMS’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-details&quot;&gt;NPPES NPI Registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adding structured data from a provider’s website to the portfolio of tools health plans use today – including plan-agnostic reporting tools, “secret shopper” visits, mailings, and a number of emerging data-driven solutions – should result in a reduction in the administrative burden of updating physician directories. Directory maintenance is burdensome. The average practice has over 20 health plan contracts and directories to maintain with over 50% of these updates being conducted via phone or fax. According to a 2019 CAQH (Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare®) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caqh.org/sites/default/files/explorations/CAQH-hidden-causes-provider-directories-whitepaper.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, the average practice spends $1,000 each month for directory maintenance. Yet at the same time, physician practices find value in online marketing as a way to attract new patients, and invest an average of $650 per month to design websites and optimize search results, according to a study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://thescript.zocdoc.com/how-much-do-other-practices-spend-on-marketing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zocdoc&lt;/a&gt;. A web standardization effort will therefore have multiple benefits. It will allow physicians to more efficiently communicate useful information via search engines that can also be used to populate health plan directories and to meet regulatory compliance, thus reducing administrative burdens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;CareJourney, with support from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, seeks to engage public and private sector stakeholders in an effort to accelerate the development and adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://schema.org/&quot;&gt;schema.org&lt;/a&gt; web standards for physician information, and to curate a portfolio of tools to structure this information on a practice’s website. Our goal is to improve consumer access to provider information while lowering physician burden. We anticipate the following benefits:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased consumer access to high-quality, accurate provider information, such as whether a doctor, practicing at this location, is seeing new patients from my plan. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consistent webpage documentation and maintenance practices that are sufficient to meet health plan regulatory requirements &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved search engine results by leveraging the structured website markup&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This effort will benefit from the active participation of the healthcare community and we welcome additional participants to play a part in our initiative.
