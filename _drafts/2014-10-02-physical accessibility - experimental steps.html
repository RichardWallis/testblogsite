A few months ago we <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2013/12/content-accessibility.html">added</a> some terms to describe the accessibility of CreativeWorks. While we believe there will be a need for refinement of that, we are also looking at adding terms for the physical accessibility of real places.<br /><br />This is a complex field. The needs of people with disabilities vary enormously. What matters to a particular blind user trying to navigate a large train station, and to a wheelchair user trying the same thing, can be completely different. Likewise, when the same two people are trying to determine whether they will have difficulties eating in a particular restaurant their concerns will not be the same as each other, or as those relevant to the station.<br /><br />For now, we want to start with a simple experiment.<br /><br />We could try to find the most complete and accurate ontology for expressing physical accessibility, and adopt it. But our experience suggests that this rapidly increases the complexity of schema.org overall, rarely helps real webmasters much, and leads to a lot of poor-quality data that reduces the usefulness of good data.<br /><br />Instead, we propose that people who have been using high-quality information keep doing so, at the same time as testing out what we are doing. We are looking for feedback, and we expect to develop a richer replacement after gathering some experience - we hope for six months to a year.<br /><br />Our initial proposal contains just two properties:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6594919674369291483&amp;pli=1">https://sdo-wip1.appspot.com/wheelchairFriendlyNotes</a>, whose range is text (including URI). The idea is to describe *how* a place tries to be wheelchairFriendly - it might link to a document, or it might provide a description.<br /><br /><a href="https://sdo-wip1.appspot.com/isWheelchairUnfriendly">https://sdo-wip1.appspot.com/isWheelchairUnfriendly</a> is a boolean, where "True" means you'll probably have a hard time getting around this place with a wheelchair. An example use would be in a review of a restaurant, or airline flight.<br /><br /><br /><br />We know there are things we are missing, and the proposed experiment is deliberately limited. We want to learn from people using this in reality: what are the most important limitations, and how do people try to deal with them?<br /><br />Some "missing pieces" are probably covered already, such as whether a restaurant has an accessible version of its menu (large print, photos, braille, onlineâ€¦).<br /><br />Others are things we think need more thought - is there a place suitable to take a guide dog to the toilet?<br /><br />And others still are refinements we ma want to add, but don't know what is the most useful way to do so. For example, the gradient, width, and turning space available on a ramp are all important information to determine whether a particular wheelchair can get use it, since wheelchairs and the people who use them come in many different sizes and shapes.
